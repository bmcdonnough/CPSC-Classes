/* CPSC/ECE 3220 example use of an unnamed pipe
 *
 * parent process sends single character messages to a child process
 *   via an unnamed pipe
 *
 * the messages are:
 *   '+' => increment the sum variable
 *   '-' => decrement the sum variable
 *   '=' => display the sum variable
 *   '!' => stop the child process
 *
 * the sum variable is set to 0 at the start of execution by using
 *   an initializer
 *
 * note that the parent and child processes will have their own
 *   copies of all the variables, including sum, with the values in
 *   the variables copied at the time of the fork()
 *
 * this example has all the code in main(), but a more common style
 *   of coding is to define separate functions for the parent and
 *   child to call
