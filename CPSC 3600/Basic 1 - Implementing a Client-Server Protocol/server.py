        Sets up the server with necessary attributes for establishing a socket connection.
        Initializes a logger for the server to log various server activities and statuses.

        Parameters:
            host (str): The host address for the socket connection. Defaults to '127.0.0.1'.
            port (int): The port number for the socket connection. Defaults to 65432.

            server = TCPServer('192.168.0.1', 8080)

        Starts the server, binding it to the specified host and port, and begins listening

        This method sets up a TCP/IP socket, binds it to the specified host and port, 
        and sets the server to listen for incoming connections. It also sets a 
        socket timeout of 1.0 seconds and marks the server as running.

        Handles incoming client connections and processes client requests.

        This method continuously attempts to accept new client connections. Once a client 
        is connected, it enters a loop to receive and process messages from the client, and 
        then sends back a response. The loop continues until the server is no longer running 
        or the client disconnects. If the client disconnects, the server should continue 
        attempting to accept a new client connection. The server should not shutdown until 
        the shutdown function is called or an error occurs. The outer loop should continue
        so long as self.is_running is True.

        Exceptions:
            - socket.timeout: This exception is expected and is handled by passing. This allows 
              the server to periodically check if it is still running or needs to shutdown. 
              The server could get stuck waiting to accept a connection without this timeout.
            - socket.error: Raised and logged if there is a problem with the socket.
            - Exception: Generic exception to catch and log any unforeseen errors.

        Usage Example:
            server.run()

        Shuts down the server by stopping its operation and closing the socket.

        This method safely terminates the server's operation. It stops the server from

        The method logs the shutdown process, providing visibility into the client's
        state transitions. It's designed to be safely callable even if the socket is
        already closed or not initialized, preventing any unexpected exceptions during
        the shutdown process.

        Processes a single client request based on the received data.

        This method takes the received data string, splits it to understand the 
        requested operation and operands, and then performs the requested operation. 
        It handles addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication operations. 
        The method returns a string response that either contains the result of the 
        operation or an error message.

        Valid operations include "ADD", "SUB", "DIV", and "MUL". The operands must 
        be valid integers. Exactly two operands must be provided for every operation.

        This function must handle the following errors and return the appropriate 
        error message:
            - Exactly one operation followed by two operands must be provided. If received 
              data does not match this pattern the server should return the following 
              error message: 
              'ERROR: Invalid number of parameters. Valid format is: <OPERATION> <OPERAND1> <OPERAND2>'
            - Only the operations ADD, SUB, DIV, and MUL are supported. If an invalid operation 
              is provided the server should return the following error message:
              'ERROR: Invalid operation. Valid operations are ADD, SUB, DIV, and MUL'
            - Division by zero is not supported. If the second operand is zero the server
              should return the following error message:
              'ERROR: Division by zero error. The second operand cannot be zero.'
            - All operands must be valid integers. If an operand is not a valid integer the
              server should return the following error message:
              'ERROR: Operands must be valid integers'

        Should any other exception be raised, the server should return the following error:
        f'ERROR: {e}' where e is the exception that was raised.

        Parameters:
            data (str): The client request in the form of a string.

        Returns:
            str: The result of the operation or an error message.

        Exceptions:
            - ValueError: Raised and handled if there's an issue with parsing operands 
              (i.e. operands are not valid integers).
            - Exception: Generic exception to catch and return any unforeseen errors.

        Usage Example:
            response = process_request('ADD 5 10')
